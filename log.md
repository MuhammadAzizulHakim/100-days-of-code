# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Wednesday, April 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Spent time committing all my code for all my Technical Blogging/Technical Writing portfolio (started from 2021) to GitHub, and writing them proper descriptions.

**Thoughts:** I've recently built up a new habit: Try to properly commit my work to GitHub, as (literally) hundreds of them are piled up unorganized on my hard drive. I think spending my first day of #100DaysOfCode organizing them would be a good idea, and might help me find new ideas.

## Day 2: Thursday, April 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Revisiting Python's Iteration, and update my old blog article about it (it's in Indonesian).

**Thoughts:** I've written it poorly in 2018, so I decided to rewrite it and also relearn Python iterations.

## Day 3: Friday, April 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Create a custom Python4Delphi GUI for scikit-learn, specially designed for running 10 clustering algorithms.

**Thoughts:** It is interesting for me to create a windows app (in .exe file format) that could operate unsupervised learning with scikit-learn instantly, without any IDE or Jupyter Notebook.

## Day 4: Saturday, April 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Researching the strengths and weaknesses of these 10 Clustering Algorithms:
1. Affinity Propagation
2. Agglomerative Clustering
3. BIRCH
4. DBSCAN
5. K-Means
6. Mini-Batch K-Means
7. Mean Shift
8. OPTICS
9. Spectral Clustering
10. Gaussian Mixture Model

**Thoughts:** This is the continuation of the third day. I am in progress writing a blog post about implementing clustering algorithms inside ScikitLearn4Delphi GUI.
